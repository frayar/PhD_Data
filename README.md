PhD Data
============

My PhD data sets, code and experimentation results

The PhD is entitled *Interactive, incremental and multi-level exploration of large collections of images*.
It has been defended in November the 22nd, 2016 in the University François-Rabelais of Tours.

II - Graphs
--------------
1. Chapter_5_Experimentations/	
  | 
  |- _X_DATASET/		
		Contains graphs generated by (i) brute force algorithm, (ii) [Hacid et al, 2007] algorithm and (iii) the proposed approximate incremental algorithm. 
        For the proposed algorithms, results are given for neighbourhood order L={2,3,4}

2. Chapter_6_Experimentations/	
		Contains the the HRNG generated by our algorithm for five data sets. 

3. Chapter_11_Experimentations/	
		Contains the 12 graphs generated for the Chapter 11 use case 
		One graph for each (feature, distance) pair

4. star.json	Basic star graph with seven nodes and six edges
